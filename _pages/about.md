I'm a senior data scientist who excels at data wrangling, machine learning, exploratory analysis, and data visualizations.  I've been featured in Wired magazine for coming in 1st place in a Kaggle Competition.  Sports are a huge passion of mine so the majority of my side projects typically will be geared towards sports analytics.

When I'm not messing around with data, I'll be practicing guitar or exploring the bars and restaurants in lower Manhattan where my wife and I live.
