The other day I came across this great [resource](https://github.com/guipsamora/pandas_exercises) for learning and/or practicing pandas.  So I decided to brush up on my skills.  Thanks to [Guilherme Samora](https://github.com/guipsamora) for creating it!  

Within the repo, there are several exercises that explore key pandas concepts such as:
* Filtering & Sorting
* Grouping
* Visualizations

Unlike video tutorials, this resource really encourages the user to write their own code in order to complete the exercises.  And what's great is that if you get stuck, there are code solutions provided to nudge you in the right direction.

I'm very familiar with pandas at this point and yet still it has been great to practice some concepts that I could use a refresher on.  I encourage anyone learning pandas to give it a try or if you are more experienced, just mess around with it for some fun.  There's a good chance you will learn something new.

My solutions to the exercises can be found in this [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/mtodisco10/pandas_exercises).
